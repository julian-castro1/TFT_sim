# TFT Display Simulator - Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the TFT Display Simulator application.

## Fixed Bugs

### 1. **Text Color Not Being Extracted**
- **Issue**: Text color from `setTextColor` commands was not being parsed, defaulting all text to white
- **Fix**: Added text color tracking in the parser that extracts and applies color from `setTextColor` commands
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`

### 2. **Missing Circle Drawing Support**
- **Issue**: `fillCircle` and `drawCircle` commands were not supported
- **Fix**: Added parsing and rendering support for both filled and outlined circles
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`

### 3. **Missing Line Drawing Support**
- **Issue**: `drawLine` command was not supported
- **Fix**: Added 'line' type to UIElement interface and implemented line parsing and rendering
- **Files Modified**: `src/types/DisplayTypes.ts`, `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`, `src/renderers/CanvasRenderer.ts`

### 4. **Transparent Background Handling**
- **Issue**: Circles with transparent backgrounds were not rendering correctly
- **Fix**: Updated circle renderer to properly handle 'transparent' background value
- **Files Modified**: `src/renderers/CanvasRenderer.ts`

### 5. **Touch Zone State Association**
- **Issue**: Touch zones were not properly associated with state transitions
- **Fix**: Enhanced touch zone parsing to better detect and store target states
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`

### 6. **Missing Font Support**
- **Issue**: `setFreeFont` and `setTextSize` commands were not parsed
- **Fix**: Added font tracking to extract font family and size from Arduino commands
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`

### 7. **Missing fillRoundRect Support**
- **Issue**: Only `fillSmoothRoundRect` was supported, not standard `fillRoundRect`
- **Fix**: Added parsing support for `fillRoundRect` command
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`

### 8. **Screen Filtering Based on State**
- **Issue**: All screens were shown at once instead of filtering by current state
- **Fix**: Updated CodeEditor to show only elements from the current screen
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/CodeEditor.tsx`

### 9. **Screen Switching on Touch**
- **Issue**: Touch zones didn't properly switch between screens
- **Fix**: Enhanced touch action handler to find and switch to target screens from parsed display data
- **Files Modified**: `src/utils/interactionUtils.ts`

### 10. **Rotation Handling**
- **Issue**: Dimension swapping during rotation was buggy
- **Fix**: Simplified rotation logic to properly detect orientation changes
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/ControlPanel.tsx`

### 11. **Limited Color Constants**
- **Issue**: Some TFT color constants were missing (e.g., TFT_BROWN, TFT_GOLD)
- **Fix**: Added more color constants including alternative spellings (GRAY/GREY)
- **Files Modified**: `src/utils/colorUtils.ts`

### 12. **TouchZoneOverlay Z-Index**
- **Issue**: Touch zone overlay might be hidden behind other elements
- **Fix**: Increased z-index from 5 to 10 for better visibility
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/TouchZoneOverlay.css`

### 13. **fillScreen Dimension Issues**
- **Issue**: fillScreen was using fixed dimensions that might not cover the entire display
- **Fix**: Updated to use maximum possible dimensions and added color trimming
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`

### 14. **Display Configuration Not Parsed**
- **Issue**: `setRotation` and other display configuration commands were ignored
- **Fix**: Added display configuration extraction and application
- **Files Modified**: `src/parsers/ArduinoParser.ts`, `src/types/ParserTypes.ts`, `src/components/CodeEditor.tsx`

## Testing Recommendations

To thoroughly test all fixes, use Arduino code that includes:
1. Multiple `setTextColor` commands with different colors
2. Circle drawing with `fillCircle` and `drawCircle`
3. Line drawing with `drawLine`
4. Font changes with `setFreeFont` and `setTextSize`
5. Both `fillRoundRect` and `fillSmoothRoundRect`
6. Multiple screens with state-based navigation
7. Touch zones that trigger state transitions
8. Display rotation with `setRotation`
9. Various TFT color constants including new ones

## Architecture Improvements

- Enhanced type safety with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Better separation of concerns between parsing, state management, and rendering
- More robust error handling in the parser
- Improved state management for screen transitions

## Known Limitations

While many bugs have been fixed, some Arduino TFT commands may still not be supported:
- Triangle drawing commands
- Polygon drawing
- Bitmap/image rendering (placeholder only)
- Some advanced text formatting options
- Hardware-specific features

The simulator now provides much more accurate rendering of Arduino TFT code with proper color handling, shape support, and interactive touch zones.
